Wrap with widget in Android Studio: Option + Enter


Stateless VS Stateful Widgets

WTF state? (Kind of similar to React useState hook)
Basically state means DATA. STATEFUL widgets can contain mutable data that can be changed by the app
or the user. These changes will force the widgets to be re-drawn on the screen.

STATELESS widgets cannot contain mutable data. There a mainly use for decorative or informational
purposes. A stateless widget can still be re-drawn but it is not is main usage.

In a stateful widget, we have two important methods, initState and dispose. InitState is called when
the widget is rendered on the screen and dispose is called when the widget is closed or to free
resources used.

LATE: Declare variable that will be initialized later

UI-
SCAFFOLD: Usually used as the top widget to hold all the content, contains usually an appBar, and a
body which may contain other widgets.

COLUMN: As the name suggest, it's a container widget that vertically stacks the widgets within.

FUTUREBUILDER: Is a widget mainly used for asynchronous calls. Primary parameters to provide are
future (usually a link, or the task to complete) and builder (context, snapshot -> contains the
state of the future [ok, completed, error...]).
