In flutter, there are two type of routes (Anonymous & Named routes)
ANONYMOUS ROUTE : A link from a screen to another that flutter does not need to know prior. Just
tell flutter go from this (screen) to another screen.

NAMED ROUTE: A defined route for linking a screen to another. Need to be defined so Flutter knows
about it.
